# force use of Python 3 on the host machine
# you probably do not want to change this

# You most definitely do not want to change the following
project_name: celus   # influences great many things, from git repo name to installation dir name
ansible_ssh_user: root   # you will have to tweek the playbook if you decide to use other user

# if you have forked celus, you might want to provide your own URL here
project_git_path_base: https://github.com/techlib/

# You might want to change the following
#
# There are three important GIT branches used in development
# - devel - for active development, not suitable for serious use
# - staging - more polished code ready for previewing new functionality before production release
# - master - code ready to be used in production
#
# we recommend using the master branch
project_branch: master

# Most of the settings for Celus are stored in Django settings files. There are two settings
# files suitable for running on a server - staging and production
# The purpose of these is to enable deployment of two different configurations from the same
# source code.
# It is only loosely related to the project_branch setting above in that
# we run the staging branch with the staging settings and master branch with production settings
# However, both the settings are equally "stable".
settings_version: production
#
# The following is the name of the PostgreSQL database that the celus playbook will create
# for Celus. If you change db_name here (not recommended), you need to modify the corresponding
# settings file in Celus code as well
db_name: celus


# Secret stuff - **you should most definitely change these**
#
# The following data are stored in the secret_settings.json file which is not part
# of GIT and only exists on the deployment server
#
# The actual values here are for demonstration purposes only. In production, you would probably
# want to use ansible vault to store the following settings, but this is outside the scope of this
# example file
# IMPORTANT: The following two settings should be different between different machines
#            and the values here should not be stored in GIT or anywhere public
# django_secret_key is used by Django for security stuff like hashing, use something long and random
django_secret_key: "Use something long like 0OfTJP7Rjctguk1DkKJXD8UQXYaX7nbt but longer"
# db_password will be used to create the database user and to create the settings file as well
db_password: "Good and strong password"
#
# the ERMS url may contain a secret portion for increased security. Because of this it is
# also stored in the secret_settings.json file
erms_url: "https://example.com/api/"
