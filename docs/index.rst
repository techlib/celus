Welcome to Celus's documentation!
=================================

CELUS (CzechELib Usage Statistics) is a web application for collection and analysis of usage
statistics of electronic information sources, such as scientific journals, etc.

It was created for use by the CzechELib consortium to provide its users with detailed statistics
of usage of subscribed information sources. It is released as open-source under the MIT license.

It supports the SUSHI protocol and COUNTER format for data harvesting, as well as custom data for
sources which do not offer this API.
