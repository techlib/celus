Trying Celus
============

Despite the deceptive simplicity of harvesting usage data for electronic resources, it can take
quite some time to set everything up. Just collecting all the SUSHI credentials, entering them in,
and testing them can take a few hours.

It is therefore important to make sure the tool you have chosen is the right one for you. We believe
that Celus is the best tool for the job, but you may have different needs. This is why we have
made it very easy to try Celus for free.

The easiest way to try Celus
============================

To try Celus, just head to the Celus website at `www.celus.net <https://www.celus.net>`_.
There you will find a button to create a trial account.
You will be able to immediately start collecting usage data for
all your electronic resources without having to install anything or pay anything. We will not even
ask for your credit card information. The first 30 days are completely on us.

Once you have tried Celus, you can decide whether you want to continue using it. Even if you would
like a separate instance for your consortium, setting up a free trial on
`www.celus.net <https://www.celus.net>`_ is always the easiest way to get started.


Asking for a custom Celus instance
==================================

The account offered at `www.celus.net <https://www.celus.net>`_ is our solution primarily
for single libraries, for consortia we offer dedicated installations. These are hosted on our
servers, but are completely under your control. We take care of the technical aspects, you take
care of the content.

If you tested Celus through `www.celus.net <https://www.celus.net>`_ and would like to try the
full power Celus can offer to your consortium, just send us an email at
`ask@celus.net <mailto:ask@celus.net>`_. We will be happy to set up a free test consortial
instance for you.


Installing Celus yourself
=========================

While it is much more work to install Celus yourself, it is a viable option for some consortia.
All the necessary information is available in the :doc:`install` section of this documentation.
