This module is intended for specialized reports which do not fit into the generic reporting
provided in `logs`.

# TODO: remove this comment when the corresponding code from `logs` is moved here.
# It is possible that in the future, we will move some of the code from `logs` to this module.
# It is also possible that a more generic reporting framework will be developed, based on the
# more ad-hoc code in this module.
