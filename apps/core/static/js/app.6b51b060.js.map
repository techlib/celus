In order\n      to properly save the data into the database, we must define extra dimensions for these two\n      columns by using the <b>Add dimension</b> button. <br> If the desired dimension is already\n      used\n      elsewhere, we just need to select it from the menu. Otherwise we need to create it. When\n      creating a dimension, we have to provide the column name as it appears in the table, that is\n      either <b>Publisher</b> or <b>Success</b>. We can also assign a different name under which\n      this dimension should be represented in the system - both in English and Czech.\n      For example we may decide to use the name <b>Availability</b> for <b>Success</b>.\ncs:\n    title: Ukázky vytváření typu reportu\n    simple_examples_title: Jednoduché případy\n    more_complex_title: Složitější případ\n    ex_metric_text: Výše zobrazená data obsahují kromě sloupců pro jednotlivé měsíce pouze\n      sloupec <b>Metric</b>.
