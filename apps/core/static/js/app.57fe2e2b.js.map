These have to be named in the \"Month Year\" form, e.g. \"Jan 2019\"\n           (month is specified using its English 3-letter abbreviation) or in\n           the \"YYYY-MM\" format, e.g. \"2019-01\".\n           <br><br>\n           <em>Note</em> - the order of columns is not important, but their names must strictly\n           match the report type specification.\n    ncd_file_example_h: Example\n    example_img_desc:\n           Example with standard dimensions <i>Metric</i> and <i>Title</i> and specific\n           dimensions <i>Publisher</i> and <i>Success</i>.\n\ncs:\n    part1: Tato stránka umožňuje nahrání dat k platformám, které neposkytují rozhraní SUSHI a nebo\n           starších dat, která již nejsou na platformě v rámci SUSHI k dispozici.\n    part2: Pro správné nahrání dat je nutné data nahrát ve  <strong>správném formátu</strong>.\n           Pro platformy, které jej podporují, můžete data nahrát\n           <strong>ve formátu COUNTER</strong> uložená do souboru ve formátu <strong>CSV</strong>.\n           Pro platformy, které nevyužívají standardní formát COUNTER, je třeba data\n           <strong>připravit podle níže uvedených pravidel</strong>.\n           Soubory ve formátu Microsoft <strong>Excel nejsou podporovány</strong>.\n    non_counter_data_h: Data mimo formát COUNTER\n    non_counter_data:\n           Vzhledem k velké rozmanitosti formátů, ve který poskytovatelé dodávají data mimo formát\n           COUNTER není možné implementovat jejich podporu.
